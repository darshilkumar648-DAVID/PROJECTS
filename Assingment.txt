QUESTION 1 : What is Power BI and how does it differ from Excel?

ANSWER, * Power BI is like a modern tool for analysing and visualizing big data.
        * While Excel is more of a traditional spreadsheet for calculations and smaller reports.
        * Power BI makes it easy to build dashboards and share insights with others.
        * Whereas Excel is better for personal data work and quick number crunching.

FEATURE                     POWER BI	                                   EXCEL

1.Purpose	      Data visualization & analytics.	                 Calculations & spreadsheets.
2.Data Size	      Handles millions of rows smoothly.	             Struggles with very large datasets.
3.Visualization	  Interactive dashboards, real-time updates.         Static charts and graphs.
4.Sharing	      Easy publishing \& collaboration.	                 Limited to file sharing.
5.Best For	      Teams needing insights from big data.	             Individuals working on smaller reports.



QUESTION 2 : Explain The Concept Of Data Modelling In Power BI? 

ANSWER, What Data Modelling Means in Power BI:

* Organizing data: It's about arranging tables (like Sales, Customers, Products) in a logical way.
* Relationships: You define how tables connect for example, linking a "Customer ID" in the Sales table to the "Customer ID" in the Customers table.
* Semantic layer: Power BI creates a model that acts as a foundation for reports, ensuring that calculations and visuals pull the right data.
* DAX calculations: Data modelling allows you to use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create measures (like total sales, profit margin) that work across related tables.

Component                 ROLE        
Table                  Store raw data (Sales, Customers, Products).                 
Relationships          Define how tables connect (one-to-many, many-to-many). 
Measures               Calculations using DAX (e.g., Total Revenue).
Hierarchies            Logical drill-downs (Year → Month → Day).
Data Integrity         Ensures clean, consistent values.


QUESTION 3 : What are the different types of connections available in Power BI?

ANSWER, In Power BI, the main types of connections are: Import, Direct Query, Live Connection, and Composite Models. Each defines how Power BI interacts with your data sources.
